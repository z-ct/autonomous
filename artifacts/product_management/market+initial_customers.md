# Market Sizing

> TL;DR - SOM of **$20 Billion** by 2020.

There are a few approaches we can take with market sizing, we consider two: 
- an analysis the market size of each industry that we hope to automate the transactions in;
- an analysis of the size of the payments market, with an estimate on what percentage of payments we would be able to automate.

Since our system is meant to be industry agnostic (at least, in the long term vision), we are starting with the second approach.

| Flat fees | source | numbers |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Number of non-cash consumer transactions | [Capgemini](https://www.worldpaymentsreport.com/sites/all/themes/wpr_theme/frontend/dist/images/other/infograph.jpg) | 426 Bn (increasing at ~10% p/a) |
| Projected number of non-cash consumer payments in 2020\* | (conservative assumption of non-increasing growth) | ~ 686 Bn |
| Average flat transaction fee per transaction | [Merchant Maverick](https://www.merchantmaverick.com/the-complete-guide-to-credit-card-processing-rates-and-fees/)\*\* | 0.10 |
| Projected flat transaction fees chargeable worldwide in 2020 | *math* | $68.6 Bn |

\*this may be useful if we choose to have a flat, per transaction fee, but we will analyse the potential business plans at a later date.

\*\*note, this is a US sum, we should average across the world.

| Percentage fees | source | numbers |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Volume of non-cash consumer transactions in 2020 | [McKinsey](http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/financial%20services/latest%20thinking/payments/global_payments_2015_a_healthy_industry_confronts_disruption.ashx) | $95 Tn (increasing at ~10% p/a) |
| Average percentage transaction fee per transaction | [Merchant Maverick](https://www.merchantmaverick.com/the-complete-guide-to-credit-card-processing-rates-and-fees/)\* | 2.10% |
| Projected percentage transaction fees chargeable worldwide in 2020 | *math* | $ 1995 Bn |

\* This is derived from various sources, we should try find more reliable numbers.

**Total Projected Payments Revenues 2020** = Flat fees ($ 68.6 bn) + Percentage fees ($1995 bn) = **~ $2 trillion**

| What's our share? | | |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Total Projected Payments Revenue by 2020 | *math* | ~ $ 2 trillion |
| Share of transactions automated by 2020 | [Fujitsu](https://phys.org/news/2015-12-percent-retail-automated.html) | 50% |
| TAM | --> | $ 1 trillion |
| Fee chargeable to payments providers per transaction \*\* | *guestimate* | 10% |
| SAM | *math* | $ 100 billion | 
| Penetration | *guestimate* of our penetration \* | 20% |
| **SOM** | *math* | **$ 20 billion** | 

\* we should derive this from the industries we plan on entering and their shares of the market.

\*\* this can change with our market plan, here it assumes we charge the payment providers for organising the transaction, which is useful for its simplicity, but not likely to be the final business plan.

# Initial customers
We derive revenue from:
- transaction fees &
- an app store like "bot marketplace"

Our customers are, therefore:
- consumers (much in the same way that consumers are customers of Mastercard, i.e. indirectly)
- sellers (they have to agree to be on our platform for payments to take place)
- bot makers (though this is a later market)

Our beachhead: 
- autonomous car manufacturers
- the US government (they have required that all cars are able to communicate with eachother by 2020 \*)
- petrol stations / conglomerates
- insurers

Our second market:
- consumer retail, starting with Amazon and their competitors
