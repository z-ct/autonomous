# Market Sizing

There are a few approaches we can take with market sizing, we consider two: 
- an analysis the market size of each industry that we hope to automate the transactions in;
- an analysis of the size of the payments market, with an estimate on what percentage of payments we would be able to automate.

Since our system is meant to be industry agnostic (at least, in the long term vision), we are starting with the second approach.

| Volume of non-cash consumer payments | [Capgemini](https://www.worldpaymentsreport.com/sites/all/themes/wpr_theme/frontend/dist/images/other/infograph.jpg) | 426 Bn (increasing at ~10% p/a) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Volume of non-cash consumer payments in 2020 | (conservative assumption of non-increasing growth) | ~686 Bn |
