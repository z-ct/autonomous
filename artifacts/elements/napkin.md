#Napkin Business Canvas

**Z-CT**
[ ] is a *transaction pipeline*
[ ] for *IOT devices and their users*
[ ] who want to *transact automatically*
[ ] to *reduce mental energy spent on small decisions and increase overall satisfaction.*
[•] We do this by *building an agency based transaction protocol*
[•] unlike *Amazon, which optimises for their profit, and still requires consent*
[•] so *you can trust in the autonomous transactions.*
[ ] This is worth *a fraction of a percent of each transaction* for our customers,
[ ] which we find through *seller channels*.
