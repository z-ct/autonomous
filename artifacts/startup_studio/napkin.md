#Napkin Business Canvas

**Z-CT**

[ ] is a *transaction pipeline*

[ ] for *IOT devices and their users*

[ ] who want to *transact automatically*

[ ] to *reduce mental energy spent on small decisions and increase overall satisfaction.*

[•] We do this by *building an agency based transaction protocol*

[•] unlike *Amazon, which optimises for their profit, and still requires consent*

[•] so *you can trust in the autonomous transactions.*

[ ] This is worth *a fraction of a percent of each transaction* for our customers,

[ ] which we find through *seller channels*.
