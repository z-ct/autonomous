# Elevator Pitch
By 2020, our *things* will buy more goods than we will. Our cars will bribe other cars to get out of our way. Our fridges will surprise us with raspberries.

This can't work unless we **trust** our devices with our money.

To build this trust, we have to replace the existing transaction model that gives all the power to the seller. We've got to automate not just the transaction, but the negotiation.

That's where Z-CT fits in. In our system: 

*The seller's side of the transaction is represented by a seller algorithm, the buyer's side of the transaction is represented by a buyer algorithm.*

Each side represents its own best interest, and we achieve a trustworthy, negotiated endpoint: and a platform on which to build the future of autonomous transactions.

# Three sentence pitch.
By 2020, our *things* will buy more goods than we will.

To do this, we have **trust** our devices with our money - and we won't trust a device that only represents the seller's interets.

To build this trust, we give the buyer and seller their own algorithms representing their own interests, giving us a trustworthy, negotiated transaction: and a platform on which to build the future of autonomous transactions.

Z-CT. Boom.
