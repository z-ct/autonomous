# Elevator Pitch
In the last two years, machines generate more information than humans. We believe that, in the near future, the same will apply to transactions.

This can't work unless we **trust** our devices (our autonomous cars, our smart fridges, our smart electricity meters) to transact in our best interests.

Therefore, we replace the existing model of autonomous transactions (a vendor suggesting a price, and accepting on our behalf in accordance with rules we have predefined) with a pure agency based model:

*The vendor's side of the transaction is represented by a vendor algorithm, the purchaser's side of the transaction is represented by a seller algorithm.*

Each side represents its own best interest, and we achieve a trustworthy, negotiated endpoint: a platform on which to build the future of autonomous transactions.
