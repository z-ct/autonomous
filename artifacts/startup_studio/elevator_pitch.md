# Elevator Pitch
By 2020, our *things* will buy more goods than we will. Our cars will bribe other cars to get out of our way. Our fridges will surprise us with raspberries.

This can't work unless we **trust** our devices with our money.

To build this trust, we have to replace the existing transaction model that gives all the power to the seller. We've got to automate not just the transaction, but the negotiation.

That's where Z-CT fits in.

*We will build a marketplace where your interests are represented by optimizing for your happiness based on cost and value. Our network will allow your devices to negotiate based on algorithmically guaranteed fairness and trust.*

Truly automated transactions will be possible since you can trust your devices to be acting solely in your best interest.

# Three sentence pitch.
By 2020, our *things* will buy more goods than we will.

To do this, we have **trust** our devices with our money - and we won't trust a device that only represents the seller's interets.

To build this trust, we give the buyer and seller their own algorithms representing their own interests, giving us a trustworthy, negotiated transaction: and a platform on which to build the future of autonomous transactions.

Z-CT. Boom.
