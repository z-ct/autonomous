# Elevator Pitch
By 2020, our *things* will buy more goods than we will. Our cars will bribe other cars to get out of our way. Our fridges will surprise us with raspberries.

This can't work unless we **trust** our devices (our autonomous cars, our smart fridges, our smart electricity meters) to transact in our best interests.

To build this trust, we have to replace the existing transaction model pushed by Amazon and the like that gives all the power to the seller. We've got to automate not just the transaction, but the negotiation.

That's where Z-CT fits in. In our system: 

*The seller's side of the transaction is represented by a seller algorithm, the buyer's side of the transaction is represented by a buyer algorithm.*

Each side represents its own best interest, and we achieve a trustworthy, negotiated endpoint: a platform on which to build the future of autonomous transactions.
