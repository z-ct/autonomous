# Expression of ZCT protocol in autonomous vehicles

Example use cases:
- bribery for passing
- bribery for parking
- bribery for certain roads
- override for emergency vehicles
- uber on empty
- negotiation for petrol
- car pooling
- decision making by vehicle whether to park
- insurance marketplace
- financial services

Pick 2, express.
override for emergency vehicles
bribery for passing

We definitely want the emergency vehicles. It will look damn sexy when some user is passing another user and then it is overrided by the emergency vehicle.

# Discussion of various potential use-cases

## Autonomous vehicle use case

There's no need to go into all of the various transactions that can occur between cars, but, to summarize, at least the following are feasible:

- bribery for passing
- bribery for parking
- bribery for certain roads
Autonomous vehicle use case

There's no need to go into all of the various transactions that can occur between cars, but, to summarise, at least the following are feasible:

- bribery for passing (e.g. our Sprint example)
- bribery for parking
- override for the above for emergency vehicles
- uber when vehicle is empty
- as well as down the waterfall services like negotiated insurance for the vehicles dependent on their use, and negotiated finance on the above given the user's risk profiles.

The difficulty in the vehicle market would be to come up with a "wedge" that would force the automotive industry to accept our protocol for this service.

We suggest that this could be possible by stressing that critical masses are required for the above-mentioned transactions to be possible. Building critical mass is helped along by the regulation that requires that by 2020, all vehicles (not just AVs), be able to communicate with all other vehicles on the road.

We can't assume, however, that these cars will be connected to the internet whilst driving, so we suggest a resilient protocol that can handle asynchronous communications (e.g., a variant on a blockchain) that communicates vehicle to vehicle before "syncing" with the net and verifying all transactions.

We will provide this communication network, and the associated transaction verification and clearing and settlement for the transactions.

*Building this protocol will allow for the critical mass required for the transactions above to work*, even if not all cars are autonomous. This will work despite cars being made by different manufacturers. This will be pro-competitive as it will be an open platform (the regulators will be on board). This will also be an independent system, which the AV manufacturers can interact with using APIs.

## Drone use case

Uber for drones: In a few years from now, drone delivery will be a fact. Every major delivery company will own a fleet of drones to deliver their products. Also users and small companies will have drones as well. All of these UAV will be communicating with themselves, and they will be aware of all the routes and timing of their trips. In that scenario, idle drones will be able to be rented to do deliveries for other users or companies. Z-CT will be the platform for this negotiation benefiting both parties. The drone owner will be benefitted making money of his idle drone, and the renter will pay a low price to deliver his package which will never be less than the costs the drone owner will have to pay.

This would follow much the same pattern as the autonomous vehicles, but in a less established and concentrated space.

## Airline use case

Here's the scenario: You are a person looking to buy a flight from JFK -> SFO a month from now. You want to get the best price, but you also don't want the plane to be full.

You search kayak.com and get the cheapest flights from all of the major airlines. The price is $375 round trip. However, last year you remember getting this flight for only $250! You go on hopper.com which tells you when to buy to get the lowest price. However, you are still risking the plane being full before you buy your ticket.

That's where Z-CT fits in. You pay us the cost of the cheapest ticket you see today. We guarantee you a seat and offer you 50% of what we save. We do not purchase the ticket until we get a discounted rate. We can get this discount by having multiple users purchase the same flight and negotiating with the airline. Or, we can get the discount by simply waiting to purchase the tickets until prices go down (a la hopper). This turns our agency model on its head, and, whilst invisible to the consumer, weâ€™d benefit from its resilience.

## Smart fridge use case

You own a smart fridge that keeps track of everything you buy. It also knows when are run out of raspberries which you usually eat when you are stressed out. It is Thursday and you forgot to buy them, but Z-CT never forgets. We know your Friday is busy, we know you'll be stressed, and we raspberry know to buy you raspberries before you do. We already did that purchase for you, buying the same raspberry you usually consume at the best price available. Now you will have them in your fridge whenever you're stressed.

Smart fridge: http://www.samsung.com/us/explore/family-hub-refrigerator/ use the pictures and ML to detect what and when you consume your groceries. When deciding the purchase the fridge will send the user a message, so that the user don't buy the same product again.
