# Expression of ZCT protocol in autonomous vehicles

Example use cases:
- bribery for passing
- bribery for parking
- bribery for certain roads
- override for emergency vehicles
- uber on empty

Pick 2, express.
override for emergency vehicles
bribery for passing

We definitely want the emergency vehicles. It will look damn sexy when some user is passing another user and then it is overrided by the emergency vehicle.


## Airline use case - greg

Here's the scenario: You are a person looking to buy a flight from JFK -> SFO a month from now. You want to get the best price, but you also don't want the plane to be full.

You search kayak.com and get the cheapest flights from all of the major airlines. the price is $375 round trip. However, last year you remember getting this flight for only $250! You go on hopper.com which tells you when to buy to get the lowest price. However, you are still risking the plane being full before you buy your ticket.

That's where Z-CT fits in. You pay us the cost of the cheapest ticket you see today. We guarantee you a seat and offer you 50% of what we save. We do not purchase the ticket until we get a discounted rate. We can get this dicount by having multiple users purchase the same flight and negotiating with the airline. Or, we can get the discount by simply waiting to purchase the tickets until prices go down.

## Fridge use case

You own a smart fridge that keeps track of everything you buy. It also knows when are run out of rapsberries whichyou usually eat on Friday nights. It is Thrusday and you forgot to buy them, but Z-CT never forgets. We already did that purchase for you, buying the same rapsberry you usually consume at the best price in the market. Now you will have them in your fridge as every Friday night.
