#Trustworthy Autonomous Transactions

As they currently exist, machine to machine transactions do not consider our best interest as users. As a result, current IoT  systems cannot be fully automated: we won't trust our devices to be autonomous ambassadors to our interests and values. Existing near-automated transaction systems simply aim to secure our consent to a repeated string of transactions.

Our vision is to build a place where **your** devices will be able to transact on **your** behalf, securing the best possible outcome for **you**. A Trustworthy Autonomous Transactions Network.

We will build a marketplace where your interests are represented by optimizing for your happiness based on cost and value. Our network will allow devices to negotiate based on algorithmically guaranteed fairness and trust. 

*Truly automated transactions will be possible since you can trust your autonomous agent to be acting solely in your best interest.*
