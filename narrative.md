####Trustworthy Autonomous Transactions

We believe machine to machine transactions fail to consider our best interest as users. As a result, current IoT communication systems cannot be fully automated: we won't trust our devices to be autonomous embassadors to our interests and values. Existing near-automated transaction systems simply aim to secure our consent to a repeated string of transactions.

Our vision is to build  a place where your devices will be able transact in your behalf, securing the best possible outcome for you. A Trustworthy Autonomous Transactions Network. 

We will build a marketplace where your interests are represented by optimizing for your happiness based on cost and value. Our network will allow devices to negotiate for their defined profit,  based on algorithmically garantied fairness and trust. Truly automated transactions will be possible, since you can trust your autonomous agent to be acting solely in your best interest.

We will conceive a marketplace that will embody a set of rules that will enable devices to participate and transact in the network. Devices will be agents transacting with each other (as buyers or sellers), trying to secure a desirable outcome with no human supervision.
