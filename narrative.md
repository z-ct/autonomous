Trustworthy Autonomous Transactions

We believe machine to machine transactions fail to consider our best interest as users.
As a result, IoT communications cannot be fully automated: we won't trust our devices to be autonomous embassadors
to our interests and values.

Our team believes that the existing machine to machine transaction system (the interesting part of IoT for us) 
has an agency flaw: 
we won't trust automated transactions where those transactions are 
optimizing for the seller's profit. 
Existing automated transaction providers dodge this problem by 
making it easier for you to consent to these transactions (e.g. Amazon Dash) or 
by getting you to consent to a repeated string of transactions (e.g. subscription based payments):
neither of which are truly autonomous.

What we propose is an agency based solution:

your interests are represented by an algorithm that optimizes for your 
utility/happiness (considering price and value) which negotiates with 
seller algorithms that optimize for their own profit
which interact on a marketplace that we would propose to build and manage.
This solves the agency problem by having your interests 
represented (you don't merely trust the other party not to exploit you), 
which would build trust in true automated transactions.

An interesting use-case would be managing transactions relating to autonomous vehicles:

when/where should they refuel (considering different 
                                           petrol prices, 
                                           location of petrol stations, possible paying rides to that location)
whether the car A should "bribe" the autonomous car in 
front of it to get out of its way if car A is in a rush (and whether Car B should agree to that bribe)
Our true target would be to allow any autonomous
transactions to be negotiated within our system/using our protocol.

Our profit would be derived from:

per transaction fees for transaction negotiated on our network
per transaction fees for using our utility
maximizing agents (though we would allow other parties to build these as well)
