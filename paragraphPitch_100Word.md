By 2020, our things will buy more goods than we will. Our cars will bribe other cars to get out of our way. Our fridges will surprise us with raspberries.

This can't work unless we trust our devices with our money.

We will build a marketplace where your interests are represented by optimizing for your happiness based on cost and value. Our network will allow your devices to negotiate based on algorithmically guaranteed fairness and trust.

Truly automated transactions will be possible since you can trust your devices to be acting solely in your best interest.
